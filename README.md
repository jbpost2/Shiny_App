# Shiny_App
Creating a shiny app to explore and model some data

Brief description of the app and its purpose.
• A list of packages needed to run the app.
• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to
running your app).  

• Here is the code you can use to copy and paste into RStudio to run my app: shiny::runGitHub('Shiny_App', username = "jgally", subdir = "Final")
